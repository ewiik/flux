This document outlines the process used to develop the regression of fully resolved temporal series of all routines sites, including treatment of missing variables and difference in temporal series length between sites (e.g. Pasqua only started in 2006).

```{r, echo=FALSE}
## source necessary packages
library("ggplot2")
library("mgcv")
library("car")

## source necessary data
if (!file.exists("data/private/regvars.rds")) {
  source("scripts/regression_routines.R")
}
regvars <- readRDS("data/private/regvars.rds")
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
