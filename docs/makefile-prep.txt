1--4: prepare data for calculating co2 flux
===========================================
1*. gasexchange_pressuredata: grabs raw hourly data from online and saves dmet.
2. weathermanipulations: grabs dmet and calculates mean wind, pressure, temperature and humidity; spits out all data frames as separate rds's ([*]data.rds)
3. pressuremanipulations: grabs all rds's created by (2) and combines them with database query tables; changes wind and DIC into correct units. saves this table as params.rds
	+++ saves archaic one using gasExchange.R as gasFlux.rds
4*. precipmanipulations-routines: sources functions/gasexchange_precipdata.R and grabs DAILY precipitation data from online, saves it as precip.rds

5: calculate CO2 flux
============================================
5a. co2_scenarios: reads in params. requires maunaloa, salcalc, gasExchangeFlex. inserts also kerri's values for winds. Creates SalCalc in params and merges maunaloa pressure with params
	+++ removes a few outliers in pH. saves updated params as params-flux.rds
5b. co2data_comparisons: reads in archaic gasFlux.rds and tests similarity with kerri's results. requires archaic gasExchange functions. no output saved.

6: prepare data for regressions for CO2 flux
=============================================
6. co2ExplVar: 
	takes pdo from online and creates an annual mean column. saves as pdo.rds
	takes soi from online and saves as soi_stand.rds (nonstand for unstandardised data)
	takes nao from online and saves as naoseasonal.rds
	takes temperature rds and computes monthly and annual means
	takes relhum rds (already monthly reso)

	takes various supporting data from database queries. creates means for chl a and
		bottle production estimates
		+++ takes out an outlier
	
	merges all above excepting climate indices, and saves as co2explained.rds
		+++ this has all the POTENTIAL predictors too	
 	
7: do regressions for CO2 flux
==============================================
7. regression_routines: combines co2 flux with predictors; subsets available predictors from
		co2explained; reads in params-flux.rds; co2explained.rds
	deals with remaining outliers
	saves data frame with selected predictors and NAs removed as regvars.rds

a--b: required functions. c--n: archaic functions
=============================================
a. salcalc.R: recalculates salinity: assumes cond as uS/cm
b. gasExchangeFlex
