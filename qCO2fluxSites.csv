5,4,McDonald,49.193596,-103.24316,2013-07-29,1:16:00 PM,1.5,14.5,0,Waited out storm for two hours prior to sampling.  Filamentous green algae bloom.  Sam to the south of the sampling location.  Connectivity looks complex with multiple inflows into the lake but no small streams evident from sampling point.  Shoreline had bands of eroding/ exposed rocks that looked sedimenary (not bedrock)
6,5,Blackstrap,51.785259,-106.438293,2013-07-31,9:00:00 AM,1.6,7.9,0,all samples were collected on July 30th and the 31st we came back for the profile.  The sample weather information is for the day of the profile.  In the valley surrounding the lake there is intense agriculture with irrigation and development of large homes.  A possible pump house at lake edge.
7,6,Porter,52.193087,-106.28688,2013-07-31,11:23:00 AM,1.825,4,17,escavation sites around the area that look like sand or gavel pits.  Road closure signs all around the area for flooding. Sediments were light brown/grey at the surface but the deeper sediment was black.  Sediment was VERY solid.  Anchor had abundance of macrophytes on it.  Although towes were shallow there were lots of zoops.  Looks like it is flooded out with lots of dead trees around shore and a steep drop off.
8,7,Pike,51.897708,-106.816893,2013-07-31,2:56:00 PM,0.99,2.5,11,Calibration is only for first sample.  Remainder of the samples calibrated at 83.7.  On side of lake there is a large pool and waterslide which might be using flitered lake water so that could be a possible outflow.  There was an aquatic weed harvester on the lake while sampling.  Lily pads and TONES of macrophyes
9,8,WhiteBear,49.773227,-102.25748,2013-08-01,8:00:00 AM,1.5,8.5,12,Calibration changed after 2.5m to 101.7. On a native reserve.  Well maintained sandy beach.  Along the shoreline there aer lots of marshy areas and macrophytes.  In the north east there are marophytes almost to the middle of the lake.  Small fishing shaks for winter fishing all along the shore.  They must fish in here A LOT
10,9,Kenosee,49.822812,-102.297505,2013-08-01,10:18:00 AM,0.98,7.4,14,"Golf course near the lake, sandy beach with imported sand for swimming.  Provincial Park.  Large filamentous green algal bloom (after looking at it more it looked like blades of grass so probably aphani).  Little kenosee lake flows into kenosee.  From previous experience little kenosee has many bays and is relatively deep with no development on shores"

13,12,Reesor,49.664684,-110.105767,2013-08-06,,0.65,5,35,Not allowed to use motor but the deepest point was close to the boat launch so it wasn’t too bad.  Connectivity 1 and 1 the inflow wasn’t flowing so suggested its ephemeral.  Littoral survey had 40 forest so changed to sand… most likely to be sand between the cobbles.
14,13,Unknown 3,50.649814,-108.971851,2013-08-05,10:00:00 AM,0,0.05,15,YSI out of a bottle lake sampling point was too shallow to use YSI.  Basically dried up and the man we talked to said that some years it dries up enough to walk across.  Looks like it was there garbage/ junk yard in the past.  EXTRODINARILY SALTY.  The mud/marsh made entrance impossible so I went into water as far as possible in waiters but the mud was like quick sand.  Didn’t really look like there was much more water out deeper.  Used the access point as the sample point because we sampled wherever we could get water.
15,14,Bitter,50.096027,-109.789666,2013-08-06,10:00:00 AM,0.03,0.9,12,Not visible inflow and outflow.  Lake is surrounded by extensive pasture land with LOTS of cows present.
16,15,Gull,50.109735,-108.498666,2013-08-06,12:01:00 PM,0.665,5,25,Re-calibration starting at 1.5m- 4m calibration was 97.6%.  Started to white cap.   Oil rigs near lake and town close.  Entrance road splits the lake in 1/2.  Road would be very suceptable to flooding.  2 permenant homes on lake and one trailer.

Phyto did multiple towes (5) and got nothing.  No inflow or outflow.  Seems like there might be a salt water lense of some type.  There were stringy spirals that were very thin not sure if they are a type of saline macrophyte or what they are.

Colverts in dyke connecting to another area possible an outflow at the opposite end of the lake.  Dyke at access point with dirt road along it.  Coble found mostly around the dyke.  The Google image makes it look like the area we sampled is recently flooded and not always par tof the lake.
